That describes well our Hero class with its three required fields (id, name, power) and one optional field (alterEgo). */

/** It's an anemic model with few requirements and no behavior. 

The TypeScript compiler generates a public field for each public constructor parameter and assigns the parameterâ€™s value 
to that field automatically when we create new heroes.

The alterEgo is optional and the constructor lets us omit it; note the (?) in alterEgo?.
